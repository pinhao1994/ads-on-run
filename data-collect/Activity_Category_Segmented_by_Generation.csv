Young kids, ages 6 to 17, who tend to be more active overall, focus on team sports and outdoor activities. While Boomers prefer fitness activities, especially low impact such as aquatic exercise, cycling, and walking. Millennials are more likely than the other generations to participate in water sports, such as stand up paddling, boardsailing, and surfing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
